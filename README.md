**how to use**

1. Input the last number in the chat
2. Then input how many numbers you want to generate
3. Execute the commands and click on the chat so it can start generating

**important**

1. I dont recommend more than 100 messages because of the cooldown
2. Make sure you are the only one typing in the chat it can break the chain!
